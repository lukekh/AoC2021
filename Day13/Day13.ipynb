It's a large sheet of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(projection)\" target=\"_blank\">transparent paper</a>! The transparent paper is marked with random dots and includes instructions on how to fold it up (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n",

    "<p>The first section is a list of dots on the transparent paper. <code>0,0</code> represents the top-left coordinate.  The first value, <code>x</code>, increases to the right.  The second value, <code>y</code>, increases downward.  So, the coordinate <code>3,0</code> is to the right of <code>0,0</code>, and the coordinate <code>0,7</code> is below <code>0,0</code>. The coordinates in this example form the following pattern, where <code>#</code> is a dot on the paper and <code>.</code> is an empty, unmarked position:</p>\n",

    "<p>Then, there is a list of <em>fold instructions</em>. Each instruction indicates a line on the transparent paper and wants you to fold the paper <em>up</em> (for horizontal <code>y=...</code> lines) or <em>left</em> (for vertical <code>x=...</code> lines). In this example, the first fold instruction is <code>fold along y=7</code>, which designates the line formed by all of the positions where <code>y</code> is <code>7</code> (marked here with <code>-</code>):</p>\n",

    "<p>Because this is a horizontal line, fold the bottom half <em>up</em>. Some of the dots might end up overlapping after the fold is complete, but dots will never appear exactly on a fold line. The result of doing this fold looks like this:</p>\n",

    "<p>Also notice that some dots can end up <em>overlapping</em>; in this case, the dots merge together and become a single dot.</p>\n",
    "<p>The second fold instruction is <code>fold along x=5</code>, which indicates this line:</p>\n",
