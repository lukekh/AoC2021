    "<pre><code>Syntax error in navigation subsystem on line: <span title=\"Some days, that's just how it is.\">all of them</span></code></pre>\n",
    "<p><em>All of them?!</em> The damage is worse than you thought. You bring up a copy of the navigation subsystem (your puzzle input).</p>\n",
    "<p>The navigation subsystem syntax is made of several lines containing <em>chunks</em>. There are one or more chunks on each line, and chunks contain zero or more other chunks. Adjacent chunks are not separated by any delimiter; if one chunk stops, the next chunk (if any) can immediately start. Every chunk must <em>open</em> and <em>close</em> with one of four legal pairs of matching characters:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>If a chunk opens with <code>(</code>, it must close with <code>)</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>If a chunk opens with <code>[</code>, it must close with <code>]</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>If a chunk opens with <code>{</code>, it must close with <code>}</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>If a chunk opens with <code>&lt;</code>, it must close with <code>&gt;</code>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>So, <code>()</code> is a legal chunk that contains no other chunks, as is <code>[]</code>. More complex but valid chunks include <code>([])</code>, <code>{()()()}</code>, <code>&lt;([{}])&gt;</code>, <code>[&lt;&gt;({}){}[([])&lt;&gt;]]</code>, and even <code>(((((((((())))))))))</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Some lines are <em>incomplete</em>, but others are <em>corrupted</em>. Find and discard the corrupted lines first.</p>\n",
    "<p>A corrupted line is one where a chunk <em>closes with the wrong character</em> - that is, where the characters it opens and closes with do not form one of the four legal pairs listed above.</p>\n",
    "<p>Examples of corrupted chunks include <code>(]</code>, <code>{()()()&gt;</code>, <code>(((()))}</code>, and <code>&lt;([]){()}[{}])</code>. Such a chunk can appear anywhere within a line, and its presence causes the whole line to be considered corrupted.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, consider the following navigation subsystem:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>[({(&lt;(())[]&gt;[[{[]{&lt;()&lt;&gt;&gt;\n",
    "[(()[&lt;&gt;])]({[&lt;{&lt;&lt;[]&gt;&gt;(\n",
    "{([(&lt;{}[&lt;&gt;[]}&gt;{[]{[(&lt;()&gt;\n",
    "(((({&lt;&gt;}&lt;{&lt;{&lt;&gt;}{[]{[]{}\n",
    "[[&lt;[([]))&lt;([[{}[[()]]]\n",
    "[{[{({}]{}}([{[{{{}}([]\n",
    "{&lt;[[]]&gt;}&lt;{[{[{[]{()[[[]\n",
    "[&lt;(&lt;(&lt;(&lt;{}))&gt;&lt;([]([]()\n",
    "&lt;{([([[(&lt;&gt;()){}]&gt;(&lt;&lt;{{\n",
    "&lt;{([{{}}[&lt;[[[&lt;&gt;{}]]]&gt;[]]\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Some of the lines aren't corrupted, just incomplete; you can ignore these lines for now. The remaining five lines are corrupted:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>{([(&lt;{}[&lt;&gt;[]}&gt;{[]{[(&lt;()&gt;</code> - Expected <code>]</code>, but found <code>}</code> instead.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>[[&lt;[([]))&lt;([[{}[[()]]]</code> - Expected <code>]</code>, but found <code>)</code> instead.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>[{[{({}]{}}([{[{{{}}([]</code> - Expected <code>)</code>, but found <code>]</code> instead.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>[&lt;(&lt;(&lt;(&lt;{}))&gt;&lt;([]([]()</code> - Expected <code>&gt;</code>, but found <code>)</code> instead.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>&lt;{([([[(&lt;&gt;()){}]&gt;(&lt;&lt;{{</code> - Expected <code>]</code>, but found <code>&gt;</code> instead.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Stop at the first incorrect closing character on each corrupted line.</p>\n",
    "<p>Did you know that syntax checkers actually have contests to see who can get the high score for syntax errors in a file? It's true! To calculate the syntax error score for a line, take the <em>first illegal character</em> on the line and look it up in the following table:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>)</code>: <code>3</code> points.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>]</code>: <code>57</code> points.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>}</code>: <code>1197</code> points.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>&gt;</code>: <code>25137</code> points.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>In the above example, an illegal <code>)</code> was found twice (<code>2*3 = <em>6</em></code> points), an illegal <code>]</code> was found once (<code><em>57</em></code> points), an illegal <code>}</code> was found once (<code><em>1197</em></code> points), and an illegal <code>&gt;</code> was found once (<code><em>25137</em></code> points). So, the total syntax error score for this file is <code>6+57+1197+25137 = <em>26397</em></code> points!</p>\n",
    "<p>Find the first illegal character in each corrupted line of the navigation subsystem. <em>What is the total syntax error score for those errors?</em></p>\n",
